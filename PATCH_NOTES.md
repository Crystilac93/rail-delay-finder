Patch Notes

v1.7.0 - Subscription Management & Persistence

Status: Ready for Deployment

📧 Feature: Subscription Manager

Self-Service Portal: Added a dedicated "Manage Subscriptions" page (/manage).
View Alerts: Users can now log in via email to see all their active route alerts.
Delete Control: Added the ability for users to delete specific route subscriptions instantly.
Navigation: Added "Manage Alerts" link to the Splash Page footer.

⚙️ Backend & Architecture

Dual Redis Strategy: Split the Redis connection into two distinct clients:
Cache/Queue (Ephemeral): Handles high-velocity job queues and API caching (safe to evict/flush).
Database (Persistent): Handles user subscription data (protected from eviction).
Upstash TLS Auto-Fix: Added logic to automatically upgrade redis:// connection strings to rediss:// when connecting to Upstash, ensuring secure TLS connections without manual config changes.

🖥️ Dashboard UX

Smart Resume: Refactored the session recovery logic. If a user refreshes the page during or after a search, the app now automatically retrieves the cached results and reconstructs the table without requiring user re-input.
State Recovery: Improved localStorage saving to include full journey metadata, allowing for seamless session restoration.

v1.6.3 - Refund Logic & Visual Clarity

Status: Deployed

🎨 Dashboard Visuals

High-Impact Status Cards: Replaced the outlined KPI widgets with bold, solid-color cards to improve readability and visual hierarchy.

Cancelled: Solid Red background.

Severe (120+): Solid Darker Red background.

Major (60+): Solid Orange background.

Medium (30+): Solid Amber background.

Minor (15+): Solid Yellow background.

🧮 Logic Updates

Refund Calculation Refinement: Updated the estimated refund logic (calculateKPIs) to reflect a "Best Case Claim" scenario.

Per-Leg Maximum: Instead of summing refunds for every delayed train found, the system now groups results by journey leg (Date + Direction).

Summation: It identifies the single highest refund amount for each leg and sums these maximums to provide a more realistic total estimated claim for the period.
